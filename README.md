# Google Docs Clone

A Google Docs clone made using Flutter, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB is a document collaboration tool that allows multiple 
users to edit and collaborate on documents in real-time. 
Flutter is a mobile app development framework used to build
the user interface for the app. Node.js is a JavaScript 
runtime used to run the backend server for the app, and 
Express is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies the 
development of the server-side logic. MongoDB is a NoSQL database 
used to store the documents and user information for the app. 
The app allows users to create, edit, and share documents with 
others, and updates to the documents are automatically synced 
across all connected devices.
